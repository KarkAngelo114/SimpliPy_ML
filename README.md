## SimpliPy_ML

- This is an open-source python library for those who wants to make models fast and easy.

- Users need to install at least Python 3.10.9 version on their machine in order to run modules/libraries/frameworks that
SimpliPy_ML relies on.

## Library overview:

SimpliPy_ML is a python library designed to allow anyone to train and build their model without extensive programming. Built on top of famous 
libraries for machine learning, the Tensorflow and Keras, and from the name itself, it implies "Simplify machine learning in Python". 
Unlike when working, example in tensorflow and/or keras for a CNN model, developers typically
code everything even using the library or framework. SimpliPy_ML does make things "simple" implementation and creating your own model. With its own 
utilities to get and load datasets, training, building, and exporting, SimpliPy_ML will make it easier for you in just few line of syntax since 
some of the functions needed to do these tasks are already pre-coded and are ready to use for ONLY SIMPLE TASKS THAT INVOLVES MACHINE-LEARNING.

## Features
This library includes:
- training and building CNN models as well as other models
- has evaluator function to evaluate model's performance
- function to load datasets (images in a folders or a CSV files)
- exporter function to export models (example in .tflite formats)
- retrain an existing model (soon)

## Pre-requisites
Pre-requisites:
- must have at least Python 3.10.9 installed
- has installed the following libraries:
    - pillow
    - tensorflow
    - keras
    - scikit-learn
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - seaborn
 
installation command for the pre-requisite libraries: pip install tensorflow keras pillow numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas seaborn
